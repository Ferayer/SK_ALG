# Sk 
this is a SK algorithm code implementation
    create_gate_list.cpp
        - type in maximum gate length of the gate list 
        - create two files to save the gate list and random unitaries for testing
    sk_eigen.cpp
        - rely on Eigen, a c++ library
        - type in max length of gate in gate list, number of iteration in sk algorithm, and a random number to pick a random unitary
    sk_qpp.cpp
        - rely on Eigen and qpp
        - type in max length of gate in gate list, number of iteration in sk algorithm
